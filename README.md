## Hi 👋 I am Batuhan! 

I am a developer who is passionate about stuff like full-stack and data science. Few tech that I enjoy working in are C#, Java, JavaScript, API, and  SQL. I am actively looking for opportunities in Data Science. Recently, I have just started with tech-blogging!

- 👨🏽‍💻 Currently working, learning and growing my skillset in Data Science, competitive coding, data structures and algorithms.
- 🤝 Open for collaborations in algorithms, analytics and data science.
- 😊 Willing to contribute in opensource development projects.
- 👍 Looking for opportunities to join as an intern/full time in deep learning fields.
- 🌐 Visit my [porfolio website](https://batuhanonder.github.io/) for complete background and contact. (Not ready yet.)
